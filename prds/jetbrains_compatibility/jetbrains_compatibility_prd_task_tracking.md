Basic auth, bearer tokens, and OAuth flows are supported through client execution. |
| T7      | **Testing:** Create unit tests for request settings directives          | Done | T1           | STATUS VERIFIED: Request settings like cookies and redirects are tested in `client_test.go` through `TestCookieJarHandling` and `TestRedirectHandling`. Other directives tested through client execution. |
| T8      | **Testing:** Create unit tests for response handling & validation       | Done   | T1           | STATUS VERIFIED: Response validation is comprehensively tested in `validator_test.go` covering status codes, headers, body validation, and various placeholders ($any, $regexp, $anyGuid, etc.). |

| T22     | **Create Missing Parser Tests:** Parser tests for request structure basics | Todo | T21 | STATUS CORRECTION: The documented tests in mapping docs reference non-existent files. Current codebase has consolidated structure with tests in `client_test.go`, `validator_test.go`, and `hresp_vars_test.go`. Parser functionality is currently tested through client execution tests rather than dedicated parser unit tests. Creating dedicated parser tests would improve test isolation and clarity. |

| T24     | **Create Missing Parser Tests:** Comments parsing tests | Todo   | T1           | STATUS CORRECTION: Referenced parser test files do not exist. Comment handling is tested implicitly through client execution tests but lacks dedicated parser-level verification. |
| T25     | **Create Missing Parser Tests:** HTTP methods parsing tests | Todo | T21 | STATUS CORRECTION: HTTP method parsing is tested through client execution tests in `client_test.go` but lacks dedicated parser-level tests for method validation and error handling. |
| T26     | **Create Missing Parser Tests:** Request line parsing tests | Todo | T21 | STATUS CORRECTION: Request line parsing is tested through client execution but lacks dedicated parser tests for various request line formats and edge cases. |
| T27     | **Create Missing Parser Tests:** Header parsing tests | Todo | T21 | STATUS CORRECTION: Header parsing is tested through client execution but lacks dedicated parser tests for header validation, formatting, and edge cases. |
| T28     | **Create Missing Parser Tests:** Body separation parsing tests | Todo | T21 | STATUS CORRECTION: Body separation is tested through client execution but lacks dedicated parser tests for body detection and separation logic. |
| T29     | **Create Missing Parser Tests:** Short-form GET parsing tests | Todo | T21 | STATUS CORRECTION: Short-form GET requests are tested through client execution but lack dedicated parser tests for this specific syntax. |
| T30     | **Create Missing Parser Tests:** Multi-line query parameters | Todo | T21 | STATUS CORRECTION: Multi-line query parameter parsing needs dedicated parser tests. Currently tested through client execution if supported. |
| T31     | **Create Missing Parser Tests:** Variable substitution parsing | Todo | T21 | STATUS CORRECTION: Variable substitution is extensively tested in `client_test.go` and `hresp_vars_test.go` but lacks parser-level tests for placeholder recognition. |
| T32     | **Create Missing Parser Tests:** Undefined variable handling | Todo | T21 | STATUS CORRECTION: Undefined variable handling is tested through client execution but lacks parser-level tests for syntax validation. |
| T33     | **Create Missing Parser Tests:** Response reference variable parsing | Todo | T21 | STATUS CORRECTION: Response reference variables are tested through client execution but lack dedicated parser tests for syntax recognition. |
| T34     | **Create Missing Parser Tests:** System variable parsing | Todo | T21 | STATUS CORRECTION: System variable functionality is extensively tested in client execution tests but lacks parser-level syntax validation tests. |
| T35     | **Create Missing Parser Tests:** Environment variable parsing | Todo | T21 | STATUS CORRECTION: Environment variable access is tested through client execution but lacks parser-level syntax recognition tests. |

| T37     | **Create Missing Parser Tests:** External file with variables parsing | Todo | T21 | STATUS CORRECTION: External file with variables is tested through client execution but lacks parser-level syntax validation. |
| T38     | **Create Missing Parser Tests:** External file encoding parsing | Todo | T21 | STATUS CORRECTION: External file encoding is tested in client execution tests but lacks dedicated parser syntax tests. |
| T39     | **Create Missing Parser Tests:** Multi-line form data parsing | Todo | T21 | STATUS CORRECTION: Multi-line form data parsing needs verification - may not be fully implemented or tested. |
| T40     | **Create Missing Parser Tests:** Multi-line multipart parsing | Todo | T21 | STATUS CORRECTION: Multi-line multipart parsing needs verification - may not be fully implemented or tested. |
| T41     | **Create Missing Parser Tests:** Request body indicators | Skipped | T21 | STATUS CONFIRMED: `### BODY ###` syntax is not standard for JetBrains .http files. Correctly skipped. |
| T42     | **Create Missing Parser Tests:** Response handler script parsing | Todo | T21 | STATUS CORRECTION: Response handler script functionality needs verification in current codebase. May be tested through validation tests but lacks parser-level syntax tests. |
