| **STATUS** | **CRITICAL GAPS CONFIRMED THROUGH TESTING** | | | **All gaps verified by creating failing tests that demonstrate missing functionality** |
| GC1     | **CONFIRMED GAP:** Multi-line query parameters | Critical | G1 | ❌ `?param=value\n&param2=value2` syntax NOT supported. Parser treats as body content. |
| GC2     | **CONFIRMED GAP:** Multi-line form data line continuations | Critical | G2 | ⚠️ PARTIAL support. Form data parsed but with newline issues and improper `&` continuation handling. |
| GC3     | **CONFIRMED GAP:** File uploads in multipart forms | Critical | G3 | ❌ `< ./file.txt` references in multipart NOT supported. Parser treats as literal text. |
