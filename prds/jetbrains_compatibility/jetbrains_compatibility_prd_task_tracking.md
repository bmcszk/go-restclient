| T20     | **Refactor:** Remove redundant tests to follow single positive/negative pattern | In Progress | T1       | Updated test_coverage_mapping.md for FR1. Analysis of FR1 revealed outdated mapping and several test/implementation gaps (e.g., short-form GET, @name directive testing, specific header scenarios) rather than significant test redundancies. Minimal test code consolidation for FR1. FR2 analysis complete: `test_coverage_mapping.md` updated to align FR2.1-FR2.5 requirements with `docs/http_syntax.md` and map to `parser_environment_vars_test.go`, `client_execute_vars_test.go`, and `client_execute_inplace_vars_test.go`. Identified partial coverage for `{{$env VAR_NAME}}` syntax and comprehensive variable precedence. No major redundancies found in existing FR2 tests; focus remains on accurate mapping and gap identification. Continuing analysis for FR3. |
| T21     | **Documentation:** Update README.md with new features                   | Todo   | T11-T19      | Document all new features and syntax support                                                       |
| T22     | **Parser:** Parse multiple requests separated by `###`        | Done   | T21 | Covered by `client_execute_core_test.go/TestExecuteFile_MultipleRequests` and `client_execute_core_test.go/TestExecuteFile_MultipleRequests_GreaterThanTwo` which execute files with multiple requests. Also implicitly by `parser_test.go` tests. |
| T23     | **Parser:** Parse request name from `### Name` format | Done   | T21 | Covered by `parser_test.go/TestParseRequest_RequestNaming` (uses `client.ExecuteFile`). This test will be moved to `client_execute_file_parser_integration_test.go`. |
| T24     | **Parser:** Test parsing of request name from `# @name requestName` directive | Done   | T1           | Covered by `parser_test.go/TestParseRequest_RequestNaming`. Ref: FR1.3                            |
| T25     | **Parser:** Parse comments: `#` and `//` | Done | T21 | `//` covered by `parser_test.go/TestParseRequest_SlashStyleComments` (uses `client.ExecuteFile`, will be moved). `#` comments implicitly handled/ignored in many client execution tests across `test/*_test.go`. |
| T26     | **Parser:** Parse all standard HTTP methods          | Done | T21 | Implicitly covered by various tests in `client_execute_core_test.go` (e.g., `TestExecuteFile_SingleRequest` (GET), `TestExecuteFile_MultipleRequests` (GET, POST)) and other client execution tests that use different methods. The parser must correctly identify these for client execution to work. |
| T27     | **Parser:** Parse request line: Method URL HTTP-Version | Done | T21 | Implicitly covered by all client execution tests in `parser_test.go`, `client_execute_core_test.go`, etc., as they all parse request lines to execute requests. |
| T28     | Parse optional HTTP version in request line | Done | T21 | Implicitly covered by client execution tests. Some test files may use short-form (no version), others full. Parser handles this for successful execution. `parser_test.go/TestParseRequest_ShortFormGET` explicitly tests no version. |
| T29     | **Parser:** Parse request headers: `Name: Value` | Done | T21 | Implicitly covered by client execution tests that set and verify headers (e.g., `client_execute_core_test.go/TestExecuteFile_CapturesResponseHeaders` for response, but request headers are similarly parsed for sending). `client_execute_vars_test.go/TestExecuteFile_WithCustomVariables` also involves headers with variables. |
| T30     | **Parser:** Test identification of blank line separating headers and body | Done | T21 | Implicitly covered by client execution tests that include request bodies (e.g., `client_execute_core_test.go/TestExecuteFile_MultipleRequests` with POST, `parser_test.go/TestParserExternalFileDirectives` with body directives). Parser must correctly identify body start. Ref: FR1.8 |
| T31     | **Parser:** Parse short-form GET requests (URL only) | Done | T21 | Covered by `parser_test.go/TestParseRequest_ShortFormGET` (uses `client.ExecuteFile`). This test will be moved to `client_execute_file_parser_integration_test.go`. |
| T32     | **Parser:** Parse multi-line query parameters (VS Code specific) | Todo | T21 | No specific client execution test identified for this exact syntax. Requires dedicated parser tests. |
| T33     | **Parser:** Parse simple variable substitution `{{variable}}` | Done | T21 | Covered extensively by `client_execute_vars_test.go/TestExecuteFile_WithCustomVariables` and other tests in that file. |
| T34     | **Parser:** Handle undefined variables (resolved to empty string) | Done | T21 | Covered by `client_execute_vars_test.go/TestExecuteFile_WithCustomVariables` (scenario SCENARIO-LIB-013-005). |
| T35     | **Parser:** Parse response reference variables `{{reqName.response.*}}` | Done | T21 | Covered by `parser_authentication_test.go/TestOAuthFlowWithRequestReferences` for client execution. Parser must recognize this syntax for the client to resolve it. Specific parser-level tests for syntax variations could be added if complex edge cases are found. Ref: FR2.5 (Note: FR mapping for this was FR7.2, task tracker was FR2.5, aligning to FR2.5 for variable type) |
| T36     | **Parser:** Parse system variables (e.g., `{{$timestamp}}`, `{{$randomInt}}`) | Done | T21 | Covered by `client_execute_vars_test.go` in tests like `TestExecuteFile_VariableFunctionConsistency` (`$uuid`, `$timestamp`, `$randomInt`) and `TestExecuteFile_WithExtendedRandomSystemVariables` (`$random.*`). |
| T37     | **Parser:** Parse environment variables (e.g., `{{$processEnv VAR}}`, `{{$dotEnv VAR}}`) | Done | T21 | Covered by `client_execute_vars_test.go/TestExecuteFile_WithProcessEnvSystemVariable` and `client_execute_vars_test.go/TestExecuteFile_WithDotEnvSystemVariable`. Ref: FR2.3 (system/env vars) |
| T38     | **Parser:** Parse file as request body `< path/to/file` | Done | T21 | Syntax parsing covered by `parser_test.go/TestParserExternalFileDirectives` (related directives, will be moved). Client execution using this in `client_execute_core_test.go/TestExecuteFile_FileBodyJSON` and `client_execute_core_test.go/TestExecuteFile_FileBodyText`. |
| T39     | **Parser:** Parse variable substitution in external file `<@ path/to/file` | Done | T21 | Syntax parsing covered by `parser_test.go/TestParserExternalFileDirectives` (will be moved). Ref: FR4.5 |
| T40     | **Parser:** Parse encoding for external file `<@encoding path/to/file` | Done | T21 | Syntax parsing covered by `parser_test.go/TestParserExternalFileDirectives` (will be moved). Client execution in `client_execute_external_file_test.go/TestExecuteFile_ExternalFileWithEncoding`. Ref: FR4.6 |
| T41     | **Parser:** Parse multi-line form data `application/x-www-form-urlencoded` (VS Code specific) | Todo | T21 | No specific client execution test identified for this exact syntax. Requires dedicated parser tests. |
| T42     | **Parser:** Parse multi-line `multipart/form-data` (VS Code specific) | Todo | T21 | No specific client execution test identified for this exact syntax. Requires dedicated parser tests. |
| T43     | **Parser:** Parse request body indicator `### BODY ###` (Rare/Legacy?) | Skipped | T21 | This syntax is not standard for JetBrains .http files or common usage. Skipping unless explicitly requested. |
| T44     | **Parser:** Parse response handler script `> {% script %}` | Done | T21 | Covered by `client_execute_core_test.go/TestExecuteFile_MultipleRequests` and `client_execute_vars_test.go/TestExecuteFile_WithCustomVariables` which use `.hresp` files that can contain these scripts for validation. The client's `ValidateResponses` method processes these. Parser needs to correctly identify the script block. Ref: FR7.4 |
