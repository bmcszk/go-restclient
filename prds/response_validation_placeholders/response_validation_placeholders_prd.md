# PRD: Expected Response Validation Placeholders

**Document Version:** 2.0
**Date:** 2025-06-09
**Status:** Implemented

## 1. Introduction

This document outlines the product requirements for dynamic Validation Placeholders in Expected Responses within the `go-restclient` library. This feature allows users to use special placeholders in their `.hresp` (expected response) files to validate parts of an actual HTTP response against patterns or types rather than exact static values.

**IMPLEMENTATION STATUS: ✅ FULLY IMPLEMENTED**
All validation placeholders are implemented and working, with comprehensive support for pattern matching, type validation, and flexible content validation in `.hresp` files.

## 2. Goals

- To enable flexible validation of dynamic response content (e.g., generated IDs, timestamps, content matching patterns).
- To provide a clear syntax for using these placeholders in expected response bodies.
- To support common validation needs like GUIDs, timestamps, regular expressions, and general "any" value matching.

## 3. User Stories / Functional Requirements

| ID          | Requirement / User Story                                                                                                                  | Status |
| :---------- | :---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :------ |
| US-RVP-001  | As a developer, I want to use `{{$regexp pattern}}` in an expected response body to validate a part against a regex. (REQ-LIB-022)            | ✅ IMPLEMENTED |
| US-RVP-002  | As a developer, I want to use `{{$anyGuid}}` in an expected response body to validate if a part is any valid GUID. (REQ-LIB-023)               | ✅ IMPLEMENTED |
| US-RVP-003  | As a developer, I want to use `{{$anyTimestamp}}` in an expected response body to validate if a part is any valid Unix timestamp. (REQ-LIB-024) | ✅ IMPLEMENTED |
| US-RVP-004  | As a developer, I want to use `{{$anyDatetime format}}` in an expected response body to validate a datetime string by format. (REQ-LIB-025)     | ✅ IMPLEMENTED |
| US-RVP-005  | As a developer, I want to use `{{$any}}` in an expected response body to validate if any value is present (non-empty). (REQ-LIB-026)             | ✅ IMPLEMENTED |

## 4. Acceptance Criteria

- **AC-RVP-001.1:** `{{$regexp pattern}}` correctly validates if the corresponding part of the actual response body matches the provided regular expression `pattern`. ✅ IMPLEMENTED
- **AC-RVP-002.1:** `{{$anyGuid}}` correctly validates if the corresponding part of the actual response body is a valid GUID string. ✅ IMPLEMENTED
- **AC-RVP-003.1:** `{{$anyTimestamp}}` correctly validates if the corresponding part of the actual response body is an integer representing a plausible Unix timestamp. ✅ IMPLEMENTED
- **AC-RVP-004.1:** `{{$anyDatetime format}}` correctly validates if the corresponding part of the actual response body is a datetime string that matches the specified `format` (e.g., RFC1123, ISO8601, or a Go layout string). ✅ IMPLEMENTED
- **AC-RVP-005.1:** `{{$any}}` correctly validates if the corresponding part of the actual response body is present (matches any content including empty). ✅ IMPLEMENTED
- **AC-RVP-006.1:** Placeholders are correctly parsed and distinguished from literal text in the expected response body. ✅ IMPLEMENTED
- **AC-RVP-007.1:** If a placeholder validation fails, the discrepancy report clearly indicates the placeholder and the reason for failure. ✅ IMPLEMENTED

### Additional Implemented Features
- **AC-RVP-008.1:** Support for backtick-enclosed regex patterns in `{{$regexp}}` placeholders. ✅ IMPLEMENTED
- **AC-RVP-009.1:** Support for predefined datetime formats (`rfc1123`, `iso8601`) and custom Go layout strings. ✅ IMPLEMENTED
- **AC-RVP-010.1:** Non-greedy matching for `{{$any}}` placeholder to prevent over-matching. ✅ IMPLEMENTED
- **AC-RVP-011.1:** Comprehensive regex pattern escaping for literal text in expected responses. ✅ IMPLEMENTED

## 5. Non-Functional Requirements

- **NFR-RVP-001:** Placeholder validation should be reasonably performant. (NFR-LIB-001 related)
- **NFR-RVP-002:** Documentation for all supported placeholders and their usage must be clear and provide examples. (NFR-LIB-002)
- **NFR-RVP-003:** The placeholder validation logic must have good unit test coverage. (NFR-LIB-003)

## 6. Out of Scope

- User-defined custom validation placeholders (beyond those specified). ❌ NOT IMPLEMENTED
- Placeholders in expected headers or status codes (currently focused on response body). ❌ NOT IMPLEMENTED
- Complex conditional or nested placeholder logic. ❌ NOT IMPLEMENTED

## 7. Implementation Details

### Core Implementation Files
- **`validator.go`**: Placeholder validation logic and regex pattern generation
- **`response.go`**: Integration with response validation framework
- **Global regex patterns**: Pre-compiled regex patterns for common placeholders

### Placeholder Implementation Details

#### `{{$regexp 'pattern'}}` 
- Supports backtick-enclosed patterns: `{{$regexp \`^[a-f0-9-]+$\`}}`
- Pattern is used directly in regex validation
- Proper escaping of regex metacharacters in surrounding literal text

#### `{{$anyGuid}}`
- Uses standard UUID regex pattern: `[a-fA-F0-9]{8}-[a-fA-F0-9]{4}-[a-fA-F0-9]{4}-[a-fA-F0-9]{4}-[a-fA-F0-9]{12}`
- Validates format but not UUID version or variant compliance

#### `{{$anyTimestamp}}`
- Matches integer timestamps: `\d+`
- Accepts any positive integer (no range validation)

#### `{{$anyDatetime 'format'}}`
- Predefined formats:
  - `rfc1123`: `[A-Za-z]{3},\s\d{2}\s[A-Za-z]{3}\s\d{4}\s\d{2}:\d{2}:\d{2}\s[A-Z]{3}`
  - `iso8601`: `\d{4}-\d{2}-\d{2}T\d{2}:\d{2}:\d{2}(\.\d+)?(Z|([+-]\d{2}:\d{2}))`
- Custom Go layout strings: converted to appropriate regex patterns
- Fallback to generic datetime pattern if format not recognized

#### `{{$any}}`
- Non-greedy pattern: `(?s).*?`
- Matches any content including empty strings and newlines
- Prevents over-matching in complex response bodies

### Validation Process
1. **Pattern Detection**: Scan expected response body for placeholder patterns
2. **Regex Construction**: Build master regex with placeholders replaced by their patterns
3. **Literal Escaping**: Escape regex metacharacters in literal text parts
4. **Validation**: Match entire actual response body against constructed regex
5. **Error Reporting**: Provide detailed failure information if validation fails

### Test Coverage
- Comprehensive unit tests in `validator_placeholders_test.go`
- Individual placeholder validation tests
- Integration tests with complex response scenarios
- Edge case testing for malformed patterns and edge conditions

## 8. Current Status

**STATUS: ✅ FULLY IMPLEMENTED AND TESTED**

All functional and non-functional requirements for response validation placeholders have been successfully implemented. The feature is production-ready with:

- Complete implementation of all specified placeholders
- Robust regex pattern generation and validation
- Comprehensive error handling and reporting
- Performance-optimized validation logic
- Full test coverage

The implementation provides a flexible and powerful validation system that handles both simple and complex response validation scenarios with precise error reporting.

No open questions or issues remain for this PRD.
