# PRD: Core HTTP Request Execution

**Document Version:** 1.0
**Date:** 2025-05-30
**Status:** Draft

## 1. Introduction

This document outlines the product requirements for the Core HTTP Request Execution functionality of the `go-restclient` library. This feature enables users to define HTTP requests in `.http` files, execute them, and handle basic response and error information. It also includes support for multiple requests within a single file and specific parsing rules for comments and empty blocks.

## 2. Goals

- To provide a robust mechanism for parsing and executing HTTP requests defined in text files.
- To handle multiple request definitions within a single file.
- To define clear parsing rules for request separators, comments, and ignorable blocks.
- To ensure basic error handling for request execution.

## 3. User Stories / Functional Requirements

| ID          | Requirement / User Story                                                                                                |
| :---------- | :---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| US-CHE-001  | As a developer, I want the library to parse request definitions from `.http` files (formerly `.rest` or `.http`). (REQ-LIB-001) |
| US-CHE-002  | As a developer, I want the request file format to support defining HTTP method, URL, headers, and body. (REQ-LIB-002)      |
| US-CHE-003  | As a developer, I want the library to send the parsed HTTP request to the target server. (REQ-LIB-003)                   |
| US-CHE-004  | As a developer, I want the library to capture the HTTP response (status code, headers, body). (REQ-LIB-004)                |
| US-CHE-005  | As a developer, I want the library to handle errors gracefully during request execution. (REQ-LIB-008)                      |
| US-CHE-006  | As a developer, I want the library to support multiple requests separated by `###` in `.http` files. (REQ-LIB-011)         |
| US-CHE-007  | As a developer, I want the `###` separator to also act as a comment prefix, ignoring text after it on the same line. (REQ-LIB-027) |
| US-CHE-008  | As a developer, I want the library to ignore blocks between `###` separators that do not contain a parsable request. (REQ-LIB-028) |

## 4. Acceptance Criteria

- **AC-CHE-001.1:** The library successfully parses valid `.http` files containing method, URL, headers, and body.
- **AC-CHE-002.1:** Parsed requests are accurately transmitted to the specified server.
- **AC-CHE-003.1:** HTTP responses (status code, headers, body) are correctly captured.
- **AC-CHE-004.1:** Network errors or server errors during `executeRequest` are caught and returned as Go errors.
- **AC-CHE-005.1:** Files with multiple requests separated by `###` are parsed into distinct request objects.
- **AC-CHE-006.1:** Text following `###` on the same line is ignored during parsing.
- **AC-CHE-007.1:** Blocks between `###` separators (or file start/end) that are empty or do not define a request method and URL are skipped, and do not affect the indexing of subsequent valid requests.

## 5. Non-Functional Requirements

- **NFR-CHE-001:** The Core HTTP Request Execution functionality must be easy to integrate into Go E2E test suites. (NFR-LIB-001)
- **NFR-CHE-002:** Documentation for parsing rules, file format, and execution must be clear and provide examples. (NFR-LIB-002)
- **NFR-CHE-003:** The code implementing this feature must have good unit test coverage. (NFR-LIB-003)

## 6. Out of Scope

- Detailed response validation (covered in "Response Validation" PRD).
- Advanced variable substitution (covered in "Request File Variable Support" PRD).

## 7. Open Questions

- None at this time.
