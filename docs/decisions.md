## YYYY-MM-DD: Initial Design Choices

- **Decision**: The project will be a Go library for sending HTTP requests defined in `.rest`/`.http` files and validating responses.
- **Rationale**: To provide a reusable component for E2E testing in Go projects, inspired by tools like VSCode REST Client but as a library.
- **Alternatives Considered**: n/a (Initial project scope definition).
